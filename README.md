Electrical wiring design is the process of planning and specifying the placement of electrical components within a building. This includes outlets, switches, lighting fixtures, and other electrical equipment. The goal of electrical wiring design is to create a safe and efficient electrical system that meets the needs of the building's occupants.

Electrical wiring design must take into account a variety of factors, including the building's size and layout, the expected power consumption, and the type of electrical equipment to be used. The design must also comply with local building codes and safety regulations, such as wire size, circuit breaker rating, and grounding requirements.

Floor plan design is the process of creating a layout for a building's interior spaces. This includes determining the placement of walls, doors, windows, and other structural components. The goal of floor plan design is to create functional and aesthetically pleasing spaces that meet the needs of the building's occupants.

Floor plan design must take into account the building's purpose, the number and size of rooms required, and any specific design requirements. The placement of furniture, fixtures, and other equipment must also be considered to ensure that the space is optimized for its intended use.

Both electrical wiring design and floor plan design are critical components of building design that require careful consideration. Proper planning and attention to detail in these areas can help to ensure that buildings are safe, efficient, and comfortable for their occupants.
